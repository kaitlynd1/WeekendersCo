      <h1>Our Family Story</h1>

      <p>We started Weekenders Co. because the people we love were already teaching us how to spend our time: outside, roughing it a little, laughing a lot. Dogs do this best — they don’t wait for the perfect conditions, they make the moment. That’s the engine behind every product we design.</p>

      <h3>What matters to us</h3>
      <p>Simple things done well: durable materials, thoughtful fit, and gear that looks at home on a trailhead or a coffee shop. We make pieces you’ll actually use, not something to file away as “nice.”</p>

      <h3>Family-first design</h3>
      <p>This is a small, family-focused company. We ask real people (our siblings, parents, cousins) to test everything, wear it for a season, and tell us what to fix. The Summit Beanie started at a kitchen table and became what it is because our family refused to let it feel flimsy.</p>

      <h3>Want the production details?</h3>
      <p>If you want specifics on materials, production runs, or wholesale, email <a href="mailto:orders@weekendersco.com">orders@weekendersco.com</a> and we’ll send what you need.</p>
