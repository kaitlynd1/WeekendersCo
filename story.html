      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>We started Weekenders Co. because we wanted a reminder — and a product — that made it easier to choose play over polish. Dogs do this without apology: they run, fall, shake it off, and ask for more. That's the kind of weekend we design for.</p>

      <h3>What we care about</h3>
      <p>Good materials. Clean design. Things that feel reliably effortless. The beanie you wear while driving up for a sunrise ski, the cap you throw on for a foggy beach walk — small rituals that turn time off into something you actually remember.</p>

      <h3>Why dogs?</h3>
      <p>They remind us that leisure isn't a luxury — it's a practice. Dogs play with reckless sincerity. We put them in human situations because doing human things should be as honest and joyful as a game of fetch.</p>

      <h3>How we launch</h3>
      <p>We begin with one product at a time so we can keep the details right: the stitch, the fit, the feel. We test in the wild (real weekends, real people), then iterate. If you want more background on production or materials, email <a href="mailto:orders@weekendersco.com">orders@weekendersco.com</a>.</p>
