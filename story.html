        <p class="story-lead"><strong>Weekenders Co. is a family-built brand founded on the promise of a life lived outside.</strong></p>

        <p>Growing up, my dad instilled in me a love for the outdoors. He always made sure our dog and I were packed up and ready to go, whether it was finding fresh powder on a mountain, tackling a new bike trail, or jumping into the nearest lake.</p>

        <p>But as I looked in my closet, I noticed my clothing didn't match the quality or authenticity of those memories. I wanted durable, fun gear that truly expressed the freedom of adventure.</p>

        <p>So, I started Weekenders Co. It’s a family commitment to our lifestyle. We're relentlessly focused on higher quality materials to ensure every piece is tough enough for the trail, comfortable for the drive home, and meaningful to your story.</p>

        <p>And since nothing expresses love for freedom and fun better than a dog, we've made them the heart of our brand. They are our ultimate companions, always ready to go and reminding us to keep things simple.</p>

        <p>Thank you for joining us on this brand new journey. We can't wait to see where you take your Weekenders gear.</p>

        <p class="signature">- Kaitlyn & Family, Weekenders Co.</p>
